This means that if an attacker wishes to take down a particular server, rather than overwhelm it with a traditional denial of service attack, they can simply make it appear as though the server itself is trying to engage in a denial of service attack. This will result in outbound traffic from the server being dropped by the provider, effectively having the same effect.
